# Multiple-Linear-Regression-titanic-dataset

**ðŸŽ¯ Objective:**

>The goal of this assignment is to understand and implement multiple linear regression using Python and Scikit-learn. You will be predicting the fare (dependent variable) paid by passengers based on various features (independent variables) such as age, sex, class, etc.

**Tasks:**

>Load the Titanic dataset.

>Display the first few rows of the dataset.

>Drop irrelevant columns that wonâ€™t contribute to the model (e.g., passenger name, ticket number, etc.).

>Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputing or dropping rows/columns).

>Identify potential features (independent variables) that could influence the fare. Consider features such as: Pclass (Passenger Class), Age, Sex, SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard), Parch (Number of Parents/Children aboard), and Embarked (Port of Embarkation).

>Convert categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.

>Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.

>Create and train a multiple linear regression model using the training set.

>Use the trained model to predict the fare on the test set.

>Interpret the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted fare.

>Plot the actual vs. predicted fares to visualize the performance of your model.
